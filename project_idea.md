Careplan is a management software for care workers.

I want to use a Python based backend.

The software will be the central tool for planners and management to manage employees with different qualifications on different locations.

Employees can also login to see information like their shift plan or update their own information like address or phone number.

Employee management includes things like onboarding/offboarding, assigning them to shifts (8 or 12 hour shifts), keeping track of their work hours, their vacation, their salary and more.

The software needs to be modular, so that features can be easily added or removed.
